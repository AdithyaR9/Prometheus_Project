    <h1>Unit Six Exercise</h1>

    <p>Write a program that will gather student names from the user until “Done” is entered. The program should then ask the user for the number of seats in the classroom. <br> <br>
        When the number of seats is less than the number of students the program should display “Error not enough seats in your class”. <br> <br>
        When the number of seats is greater than or equal to the number of students the program should assign each student a seat randomly. <br> <br>
        <em>Data Storage:</em>
        <ul>
            <li>Names – ArrayList of Strings</li>
            <li>Seats – ArrayList of Integers</li>
        </ul>
